Amy bought this car to replace her little Subaru after graduating from college. This car was incredibly fun to drive and looked great. Ours was a 5 speed and looked just like the one in this photo. It was a bit noisy inside and fifth gear was geared really low, I guess for fuel economy.

Unfortunately, our lifestyle became less compatible with the car as the years went on. We enjoyed cycling and had a bike rack for it, but it was a bit clumsy. Then, we had our first child. Trying to put the car seat in the back of that car wasn't working out. Our first vacation in the car was a disaster. We traded it in for a minivan shortly thereafter.
