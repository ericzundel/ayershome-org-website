## Eric-o-meter: 6/10

This car was my inheritance from my grandfather. He was an artist, spent most of his life in New York City, and drove like it. You know that car with the little guy who can barely see over the steering wheel zooming around everyone? That was my grandfather. My dad liked to joke that he drove by feel, with one hand on the edge of the steering wheel and the other on the horn. But don't judge him by his driving, he was a remarkable man.

I loved the Honda Accord, but this car was much newer - I was advised to take it. There was a Sable factory in Atlanta right near where I grew up. What can I say about this car. This car has the stock 6 cylinder engine. It was plenty powerful. It was practical. It was reliable. It was a relative beauty. Don't get me wrong, it was ugly, but not quite as ugly as its sibling, the Taurus.
