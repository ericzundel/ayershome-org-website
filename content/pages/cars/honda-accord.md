## Eric-o-meter: 10/10

I drove a 1979 Accord in college in the early 90's and absolutely loved it. One of my all time favorite cars. It was a hand me down from my sister, which was formerly driven by the homecoming queen from our high school. Ours was just like this one, with maroon interior and silver paint job. I can still hear it cranking up!
